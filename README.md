These files contain some of the ruby programs I wrote while learning and experimenting. Check out the the mastermind and tic tac toe command line games. Super interesting!

Checkout this video to know how mastermind is played: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPeBUDXKGqA

Pointers to play mastermind:

1. You are up against the computer. The computer will set a 4-digit code using numbers between 1-6
2. Enter your name and start guessing. You get 10 attempts to guess the code.
3. The first guess will obviously be random. 
4. The computer will provide you a feedback as to how close your guess was. The number of
   'x's denote the number of perfect hits and the number of 'o's denote the digits you guessed 
   correctly to be in the code but out of position.
5. Use the feedback wisely to make your next guess. Combine it with the power of your brain to
   crack the code. Best of luck!
